<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## This is a very early beta of a 'model' manager for AI models. 

It is designed to help manage the various versions of models that are used in a project. 
Think of it as a ModOrganizer or Vortex Mod Managed for AI models.  Essentially it is a central repository for all 
(most?) of your CivitAi (and other i.e Hugging Face) models.  You can deploy these models to specific AI software 
(A1111, ComfyUI, etc) .

You would be able to store all your models in a separate location from your software, and deploy them as needed.  
Plans are to use soft-links where applicable.  It is desktop software, and only deploys locally at this point.

Eventually it will have a live interface to CivitAI to download and monitor models.

Note: This is my first 'major' Python project and I am learning as I go, there is a lot of non-pythonic code here.  
There is a lot of repeated code that eventually needs to be moved to functions/classes/etc.  
I have done similar things in different ways in various places of the program.  Sometimes because I learned something
new/better, sometimes because I forgot I had done it before.  I am working on cleaning it up as I go.  
Some code is documented, some is not.  I am working on that as well.  I am also working on adding more comments to 
the code.
